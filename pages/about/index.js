              Black Orchid Research is founded on the idea that data and
              story-telling should complement one another in solving problems.
              These problems may be organizational or more global. Our data
              scientists use data to drive insight for organizations and policy.
              The company combines analytical tools of data science with an
              applied understanding of social sciences.
